            <h1>TeamWork</h1>   
  <p>   
  Team work has many different meanings. Principally, it is the cooperation of
  a group of people to work as a unit to effectively and efficiently complete a
  a task.
  Definition of team work:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A general sense people talk of teamwork when they want to
  	  emphasise the virtues of co-operation and the need to make use of
	  the various strengths of employees  </li>
  <li>Teamworking involves
  	  organising employees into teams based on a distinct product, part
	  of a process, or service â€“ often cutting across existing functional
	  divides </li>
   </ul>
<p>		
  It is common to hear of management teams, production teams,
  service teams or even whole organisations being referred to as teams.
  Employers should stress the importance of employees working as a team and
  advertise for staff with the ability to work in such a way. In a general
  sense people talk of teamwork when they want to emphasise the virtues 
  of co-operation and the need to make use of the various strengths of
  employees.<a href = "http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/g/7/B14_1.pdf">Link</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2>
  Importance of Teamwork
  </h2>
  
 <p> Teamwork can bring out competition in a company, either competition externally 
  to exceed the capability of another company or internally to improve efficiency
  and/or quality in a product or process. Competitiveness improves:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>productivity</li>
  <li>quality and innovation</li>
  <li>opportunities for technological advances.</li>
  <li>motivation and commitment</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For a company to stay competitive, it is important to optimise equipment and 
  use people effectively. The bullet points above highlight the main area covered 
  in this section.</p>
  
  <b>Improving productivity</b>
  <br/>
  <p>Labour is more effective and efficient, this improves productivity by:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> maximising the different strengths and skills of team members so
  that a greater variety of tasks may be tackled </li>
  <li> delegating the order and allocation of tasks to the group, thus
  avoiding day-to-day problems such as bottlenecks </li>
  <li> devolving some managerial control to the work group or the team
  leader and so reduce the number of levels of management </li>
  <li> encouraging employees to undertake a wider range of tasks</li>
  <li> making team members more directly accountable to customers -
  whether external or internal.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>Improving quality</b><br/>
  <p>
  The establishment of quality and customer satisfaction should be at the top of the
  agenda of most companies has been the driving force behind many
  teamworking initiatives. The involvement of employees and their
  representatives, which is an essential element of teamworking, can make
  a major contribution to improved quality. The temptation to regard quality
  as a management only issue still continues in many organisations - and
  means that many opportunities to improve quality are lost.</p>
<p>
  A survey (2) by the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM) found that
  about two-thirds of organisations in the United Kingdom well advanced in
  the introduction of Total Quality Management (TQM) programmes, had
  identified various kinds of teamwork as vital tools for its implementation.</p>
  
  <p>Increased autonomy together with training in diagnostic and problem
  solving techniques, such as statistical process control, allows teams to
  take more responsibility for quality. This can lead to reductions in waste, a
  move towards continuous improvement and product or process
  innovations. Where teams develop their own recommendations for
  improvements or solutions to problems, they are much more likely to
  implement them successfully.</p>
  
  <p>The increased knowledge of the process or service that goes hand in hand
  with successful teamworking will encourage teams to take a broader
  perspective. This can help teams to appreciate the wider implications of
  ideas they may have for changes or improvements.</p> 
  
  <p>According to industry week [2] <a href = "http://www.industryweek.com/boost-quality"> Link</a>,
   there are 5 ways to best improve quality at a high level:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Reward success.</b> There's a fine line between crushing creativity and 
  reducing critical errors in the production line. Design a system that 
  avoids punishing failure but instead rewards success in boosting output 
  while also keeping a lid on serious issues. Seek a profitable balance and 
  then incent employees to perform at that level, consistently.</li>
  <li><b>Measure team performance.</b> Avoid assigning blame to a single employee 
  when the line suffers trouble. Instead, measure team performance. Use shared 
  destiny to encourage workers to watch each other's backs while striving for 
  the greatest possible output, and then reward creatively when the team 
  exceeds targets safely.</li>
  <li><b>Avoid the abstract.</b> Don't shirk from trouble. Instead, if the line 
  has suffered lapses in the past, make sure those stories are passed on to 
  newer employees. Internalize the issues -- not for guilt's sake but that so 
  everyone on the line takes the quest for safety as a personal mandate.</li>
  <li><b>Study peers and success stories.</b> Encourage workers to learn from 
  those who've come before. How are the safest lines maintained? What makes 
  them so safe? If possible, bring in leaders of these operations to talk to 
  your workers about process and lessons learned. Capture questions, answers, 
  and ideas for regular review.</li>
  <li><b>Process over product.</b> Don't let the quest for output obscure the 
  need for safe procedures. Document safe processes meticulously so that newer 
  workers avoid taking risks that might compromise their own or others' safety 
  on the line -- or worse, upon delivery to the customer.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <b>Technological advances</b><br>
  <p>Traditional mass production techniques required large numbers of
  identical products to be produced to achieve economies of scale. New
  technology enables production to be quickly tailored to customer
  requirements - often on an individual basis.</p>
  
  <p>Mass production techniques, where jobs are broken down into simple
  tasks, are not suitable for the new customer focused manufacturing nor
  the expectations of an educated workforce. Organisations need workers to
  be more flexible, to co-operate with other workers, supervisors and
  managers throughout the organisation, to operate sophisticated
  technology and to be more adaptable. In addition, the sheer complexity of
  operations in industry, commerce and the services place them beyond the
  expertise and control of any one individual. In these circumstances some
  form of teamwork becomes not just desirable but essential.</p>
  
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>Production line work has traditionally been characterised for many by
  monotony and boredom. Jobs were broken down into small repetitive
  tasks which required little skill and provided minimal job satisfaction.
  Consequently motivation levels tended to be low and there was a need for
  close supervision. Many production lines still operate in this way.</p> 
  
  <p>Modern and improved production and service industries require workers who, apart from
  being multi-skilled and well trained, are able to take many of their own
  decisions. To do this properly, it is better if workers are motivated by the
  desire to do a good job and be recognised for their contribution to a
  successful organisation. This has led to a new emphasis on redesigning
  jobs to provide greater job satisfaction and improved quality of working
  life.</p> 
  
  The organisation of work into teams provides an opportunity to fulfill many
  of the principles of good job design identified by researchers (3). These
  include:
  
  <ul>
  <li>Variety of tasks - requiring the use of several skills</li>
  <li>Autonomy - of the operator in deciding the order or pace of work</li>
  <li>Identity - The task forms a whole job or larger part of the whole job</li>
  <li>Responsibility - Individuals accountable to each other for what is produced</li>
  <li>Feedback - Constant information on how the operator is performing</li>
  <li>Social contact - Constant opportunity for interaction with colleagues</li>
  <li>Balanced Workload - team members can help each other to even out peaks 
  and troughs in their work</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><strong>Implementing Teamwork</strong></h2>
  <p>
  The following link has an in depth description of the implementation, below is
  an overview to the process:[1] <a href = "http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/g/7/B14_1.pdf"> ACAS</a>
  </p>
  
  <h3><b>Preparing for change</b></h3>
  <p>
  Study the advantages and disadvantages. attend conferences to see the success
  of other companies.<br>
  Review how team work operates and arrange to visit other companies who are 
  willing to share there experiences. Having a network is a good thing.</p>
  
  <h3><b>Senior management commitment</b></h3>
  
  <p>Ensure senior managers are satisfied that they know how it will contribute 
  to their overall strategy.<br>
    A strong commitment by senior management is important to  move to teamworking.</p>
  
  <h3><b>Changing the culture</b></h3>
  <p>
  The tasks to change culture include:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>providing a vision and communicating it</li>
   <li>encouraging the free flow of ideas and initiative</li>
   <li>training and developing employees to take increased responsibility</li>
   <li>overseeing teams and ensuring they meet objectives.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>				  
   Harmonisation of differences in matters such as pay
   and grading systems, payment periods and sick leave can be important.
   Visible signals such as common canteen facilities and parking areas can
   help break down traditional barriers between blue and white collar
   workers and between various levels of the management hierarchy.</p>
   
   <h3><b>Securing good employee relations</b></h3>

   <p>Good communications and consultation play a crucial part in the
   introduction and maintenance of teamworking. 
   
   A variety of methods of&nbsp; communications may be used including:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>	meetings, large and small</li>
   <li> team briefings</li>
   <li> consultative committees</li>
   <li>joint working parties</li>
   <li>computer networks- particularly intranet systems</li>
   <li>newsletters</li>
   <li>company journals</li>
   <li>letters to employees</li>
   <li>notice boards</li>
   <li>surveys to monitor effectiveness of communications.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3><b>Training and developing employees </b></h3> 
   <h2>Multivoting</h2>
        <p>
        Brainstorming, by definition, generates a long list of ideas. 
        "However, many of these ideas are not realistic or feasible.    
        The Multivoting activity allows a group to narrow their list or options
        into a manageable size for sincere consideration or study. It will not
        help the group make a single decision but can help the group narrow a 
        long list of ideas into a manageable number that can be discussed and 
        explored. It allows all members of the group to be involved in the 
        process and ultimately saves the group a lot of time by allowing them 
        to focus energy on the ideas with the greatest potential"(3).  
        </p>
       <p> "When to use Multivoting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> When the group has a long list of possibilities and wants to narrow
        it down to a few for analysis and discussion.  </li>
        <li> When a selection process needs to be made after brainstorming"(3).</li>
         </ul>

      <p>  To boost the employees' team working skills, the consultancy company 
        recommends that a multivoting activity is carried out. </p>
        
           <h3>Guidelines for Conducting the Multivoting Activity:</h3>
         <ol>  
    <li>"Brainstorm a list of options. Conduct the Brainstorming activity 
    to generate a list of ideas or options.</li>
    <li>Review the list from the Brainstorming activity. Once you have 
    completed the list, clarify ideas, merge similar ideas, and make sure 
    everyone understands the options. Note: at this time the group is not to 
    discuss the merits of any idea, just clarify and make sure everyone 
    understands the meaning of each option.</li>
    <li>Participants vote for the ideas that are worthy of further discussion.
    Each participant may vote for as many ideas as they wish. Voting may be by 
    show of hands or physically going to the list and marking their choices or 
    placing a dot by their choices. If they so desire, participants may vote for
    every item.</li>
    <li>Identify items for next round of voting. Count the votes for each 
    item. Any item receiving votes from half the people voting is identified for
    the next round of voting. For example, if there are 12 people voting, any 
    item receiving at least six votes is included in the next round. Signify the
    items for the next vote by circling or marking them with a symbol, i.e., all
    items with a star by the number will be voted on the next round. 
    </li>
    <li>Vote again. Participants vote again, however this time they may only
    cast votes for half the items remaining on the list. In other words, if 
    there are 20 items from the last round that are being voted on, a 
    participant may only vote for ten items.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 4 and 5. Participants continuing voting and narrowing 
    the options as outlined in steps 4 and 5 until there is an appropriate 
    number of ideas for the group to analyse as a part of the decision-making 
    or problem solving process. Generally groups need to have three to five 
    options for further analysis.</li>
    <li>Discuss remaining ideas. At this time the group engages in discussing
    the pros and cons of the remaining ideas. This may be done in small groups 
    or the group as a whole. 
    <li>Proceed with appropriate actions. At this point the group goes to 
    the next steps. This might be making a choice of the best option or 
    identifying the top priorities."(3) </li>
        </ol>

  <p> Moving to multi-skilled teams will alter the range and style of working.
   Training needed is:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>additional skills training to enable team members to be able to
   operate with the required flexibility. In manufacturing this may
   include being able to operate a range of machines but may also
   incorporate skills such as the operation of computers and record
   keeping</li>
   <li>interpersonal and team building skills to help team members
   communicate with each other, deal constructively with conflict and
   criticism and recognise the value and achievements of others</li>
   <li>problem solving skills and techniques such as the use of control
   charts, brainstorming and 'fish bone' diagrams</li>
   <li>leadership training for one or more team members.</li>
   </ul> 
   
   <h3><b>Appraising employees</b></h3>

   <p>There are usually two elements to employee appraisal:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>An appraisal of performance, linked to work objectives upon which
   pay is often based</li>
   <li>An assessment of development covering personal skills, knowledge
   and experience linked to future potential.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h3><b>Rewarding Employees</b></h3>
   
   <p>It is important when introducing teamwork to make any necessary
   changes to the reward system so that it supports the new ethos. The
   failure to reward the employee for the good work will result in the 
   employee feeling underappreciated and lose motivation. It also may 
   lead to the employee not believing in the system.</p>
   
   <h3><b>Paying For skills</b></h3>
   
   <p>All of
   these advantages are favourable for successful teamworking but as with
   any method of payment there are attendant disadvantages. These
   include:</p>
   
   <ul>
   <li> The high demand for training and the considerable resources
   required to satisfy the demand</li>
   <li> The danger that more people may demand training in skills than is
   necessary to perform the required tasks.</li>
   </ul> 
   
   <h3><b>Evaluating jobs</b></h3>
   
   <p>The need for constant revisions to job
   descriptions and re-evaluation of jobs can become a costly impediment to
   change.
    There are ways of overcoming this problem -
   for instance by:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>paying employees for their skills and knowledge rather than the
   requirements of the job</li>
   <li> developing a few broadly defined grades within which defined skill
   levels provide a basis for salary increases </li>
   <li> evaluating jobs on a group basis where the team is responsible for
   a set of tasks and team members receive the same base pay.</li>
   </ul> 
   
   <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
  <p> Teamworking is a process that requires on going review and is a process 
   of continuous improvement and innovation. Therefore, fits into the TQM 
   Methodology. In order to achieve high performance,
   teams require regular changes and challenges. These may include:
   changes to team personnel; new tasks; re-examining the contribution the
   team makes to the overall business aims; and ensuring that the team has
   regular dealings with other teams.</p>
   
  <p> The best ways to ensure
   that teams continue to develop is to move towards self-regulation - an
   important way of monitoring the progress of teams is to assess the level
   of dependence on management.
   Reorganising the workforce into teams, when successfully
   developed, teamworking has been shown to be a way of improving
   competitiveness and at the same time enhancing the quality of working
   life for employees.</p>
