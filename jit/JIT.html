  <h1>Just in time (JIT)</h1>
  <p>
"The Just-in-Time (JIT) philosophy advocates: producing and/or delivering only 
the necessary parts, within the necessary time in the necessary quantity using
the minimum necessary resources. Ideally, the appropriate number of parts are 
produced and immediately shipped when the customer order is received. Upstream 
processes and suppliers deliver exactly the appropriate quantity of components 
when the downstream process needs them. In this situation there is no need for 
inventory"(1). 
</p>
<h2>Pull System</h2> 
<p>
"In conventional production systems, parts produced by one process, as defined by
the production schedule, are delivered to following processes even if they are
not yet needed there. This method may be good when parts can be produced on 
schedule throughout the whole process. But if just one process has trouble and
the line stops, the processes directly related to the troubled one will
suffer from either a shortage or a backup of parts. This is called a “push” 
system. The pull system eliminates under or over production by limiting 
production to those parts demanded by the next downstream process. This helps to 
avoid bottlenecks in production"(1). 
</p>
<h2>Kanban</h2>
<p>
"A visual sign or signal that conveys a set of instructions to either withdraw 
parts or produce a given product is called a kanban. Kanban is generally 
recognized as a card that passes between processes, communicating
information as to what materials to replenish. In is the instrument that enables
the pull system to function. The pull system, using appropriate kanban, allows 
material to flow through manufacturing"(1).

<p>
    Figure 1 illustrates how the Kanban is implemented in production:
    <ol>
    <li>"Production starts when the customer returns Kanban for replenishment of 
    purchased parts.</li>
    <li>The customer order is shipped from final bank. (Finished Goods Area)</li>
    <li>Final assembly produces and replenishes the final bank.</li>
    <li>Corresponding component needs are communicated with a Kanban that travels 
    upstream.</li>
    <li>Those needs are filled by the line side market area.</li>
    <li>The paint process then replenishes the market area.</li>
    <li>Corresponding component needs are communicated with a Kanban that travels 
    upstream.</li>
    <li>Those needs are filled by the line side market area.</li>
    <li>The molding operation then replenishes only those items depleted from 
    the market"(1).</li>
    </ol>
