  <h1>Quality</h1>
  <h2>Definition of quality</h2>
  <p>A high quality product has eight key aspects: 
    <ul>
    <li> Reliability- how often does the product fail? </li>
    <li> Durability- how long does it last? </li>
    <li>Conformance -is the product made according to specification?</li>
    <li>Serviceability- how easy is it to repair the product?</li>
    <li>Perceived quality- what is the image of the company? </li>
    <li>Features- what does the product do?</li>
    <li>Performance- will the product do the intended job?</li>
    <li>Aesthetics- what does the product look like?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Quality Control</h2>  
  <p>Quality is inversely proportional to variability. Monitoring of the control
 inputs allows for process optimization. The ultimate result is a higher quality 
product. The feedback loop between the final product and the controllable inputs 
to the process ensures continuous improvement of final outputs. Figure 1 
summarizes the introduction of quality control in production process.

<p>
The quality of a product depends on product development and production 
engineering. During product development the design should be robust and with 
minimum response to noise. Hence, performance variations due to variability are
reduced. At the production engineering stage, the process should produce uniform
product economically. The company continues to service the product after it is 
handed over to the customer to maintain reputation despite any quality loss.<br>
There are two types of quality control: on-line and off-line. 
On-line quality control if part of the production engineering process. It aims
to keep mean values on target and maintain inherent standard deviations of the 
process. 
Off-line quality control features in product development and production 
engineering. It covers system design, parameter design, tolerance design, and 
removal of causes for defects. 
Some of the most common quality tools are Cause & Effect diagrams, Pareto charts,
Control charts, and Check sheets.  
</p>
<h3> Cause & Effect (Fishbone) Diagrams</h3>
<p>
A Cause & Effect diagram like the one on figure 2 is used to identify problems in the 
initial design and manufacturing process. The diagram has five branches 
corresponding to the five main areas that could cause a defect. Each area can be
branched further to pinpoint a specific problem and understand who is 
responsible for it. This helps to identify the root causes of
defects in the final product.

<h3>Check sheets</h3>
<p>
    "The Check Sheet is a simple document that is used for collecting data in real 
    time and at the location where the data is generated. The document is typically
     a blank form that is designed for the quick, easy, and efficient recording of 
     the desired information, which can be either quantitative or qualitative. When 
     the information is quantitative, the check sheet is sometimes called a tally 
     sheet. The check sheet is one of the seven basic tools of quality control made 
     popular by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa.
     A defining characteristic of a check sheet is that data is recorded by making 
     marks (“checks”) on it. A typical check sheet is divided into regions, and 
     marks made in different regions have different significance. Data is read by 
     observing the location and number of marks on the sheet"(2). The five types 
     of check sheets include:
     <ul>
         <li>Classification check sheet </li>
         <li>Data collection check sheet </li>
         <li>Frequency check sheet </li>
         <li>Measurement scale check sheet </li>
         <li>Check list </li>
     </ul>
 </p>
 <h4> Classification check sheets</h4>
<p>
    The classification check sheet classifies traits such as defects into different 
    categories. It provides a visual overview of the problem areas on different days
    of the week (2). 
</p>    
    <figure>

 <h4> Defect location check sheet</h4>
<p> 
    This type of check sheet indicates the physical location of a defect on a 
    picture. The defect location check sheet reveals an area of a product that tends
    to display most of the defects. Once this is known, the team can go back to the
    process to see what it is about the specific place of the product that is 
    causing the defects (2). 
</p>
<h4> Frequency Check Sheet</h4>
<p>
    "The presence or absence of a trait or combination of traits is indicated. 
    Also, number of occurrences of a trait on a part can be indicated"(2). If only 
    the number of defects is tracked, then "wrong color" will not be identified as
    having the highest frequency of occurrence. The "wrong color" category has to be
    broken down to unveil that green is giving the most defects.

<h4> Measurement scale check sheet</h4>
<p>
"A measurement scale is divided into intervals and measurements are indicated 
by checking an appropriate interval"(2).

<h4>Check list</h4>
<p>
The items to be performed for a task are listed so that as each is 
accomplished it can be marked as having been completed.
