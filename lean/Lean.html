  <h1>Lean Manufacturing</h1>
  <p>
Lean manufacturing represents a journey that should never end because it involves
 the identification and elimination of waste, and the continuous improvement of
 all operations involved in any form of work. It is well-known fact that the 
 implementation of Lean production systems has saved some companies millions of
 dollars over the last 20 years or so. People are skeptical and not prepared to
invest in themselves even though some of the Lean principles cost very little money to
implement 
</p>
<h2>Lean Principles </h2> 
<p>
Lean principles involve many different ways we can become more efficient by working
smarter and not harder. A few of the Lean methods that follow will provide a brief explanation
of how they can assist us to operate any type of operation leaner and more efficiently.  
</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>"Cellular Manufacturing is a system that helps build a variety of products from a part family
with as little waste as possible. A number of machines, work-handling equipment, and people
are arranged for a smooth flow of materials and parts through the process.
Cellular manufacturing helps to create a concept known as single or one-piece flow.
Equipment and the workstations are arranged in sequences that allow for a smooth flow of materials
and components through the process. The cell is made up of the workers and the equipment required
to perform the steps in creating the product. The layout of the equipment and the workstations is
determined by the logical sequence of production.</li> <br/>
    <li>Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) is a process of on-going improvement that involves
everyone – management, supervisors, and workers to improve operations and reduce costs.
Transforming a factory into a Lean manufacturing operation is a gradual process that can be
described as a journey rather than a destination. The journey to Lean is an ongoing one; it requires a
strong commitment, an appropriate organizational structure, and just plain dedicated work. In Lean
manufacturing, this change for the better can result in gradual improvement of products, workplace
efficiency, customer service, and reduction of waste. </li> <br/>
    <li>Pull/Kanban Systems - the pull concept in Lean production is to respond to the needs of the
customer so they know they can get what they want, when they want it.
 Lean companies design their operations to be more responsive to the varied and changing
needs of their customers. Lean companies that are able to create such an operation can avoid the
more traditional batch-and-queue method, which is generally acknowledged to be the worst way
to process material through a factory. A more continuous flow results in items being moved
immediately from one workstation to the next as soon as they are ready. </li> <br/>
    <li>Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a program for making the effectiveness of all
manufacturing equipment as reliable as possible. The goal of TPM is to prevent
breakdowns and defects, but to do it in ways that are efficient and economical.
 The importance of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) cannot be overlooked because it
plays such an important role in the effectiveness of Lean manufacturing. As in personal health
care insurance, TPM may be considered the heath care of our manufacturing machine and tools
which are required to effectively reduce waste and run an efficient, continuous manufacturing
operation, business, or service operation. The cost of regular TPM is very small when it is
compared to the cost of a major breakdown. </li> <br/>
    <li>Value Stream Mapping is the actions (value added and non-value added) required to bring a
product’s production path (materials and information) starting from raw materials and into
the customer’s arms.
Value Stream mapping is a technique for analyzing material and information flow; it
helps provide an overview for improving the manufacturing system. The VSM approach works
to try to improve the whole process, not just optimizing the parts or cherry picking (taking too
narrow a view). It is basically a flow-charting technique that uses icons to represent activities and
locations. </li> <br/>
    <li>Workplace Organization - Lean manufacturing cannot succeed in a workplace that is
cluttered, disorganized, or dirty. Many companies today are working on the 5S system that
consists of effective workplace organization and standard work procedures that are favorable to
Lean manufacturing principles.
The workplace environment is important in helping to introduce Lean manufacturing. An
untidy or disorganized workplace can lead to wasted energy, whether it be avoiding obstacles or
searching for materials and tools. </li>
    </ol>
