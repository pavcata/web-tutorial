  <h1>  Total Quality Management</h1>
  <h2>What is Total Quality Management (TQM)?</h2>
  
  <p>
  Total quality management (TQM) is a strategy aiming to improve quality, 
  efficiency, and productivity. A key goal of TQM is to enable companies to 
  provide a high-quality customer service. It transforms the firm into a highly
  competitive organization with strategic focus and definite plans for the long 
  run. TQM is about continuous improvement of production processes, manifested 
  by quality measurement and defect reduction techniques, customer focus, cost 
  and waste reduction, statistical process control, and changes in organizational 
  philosophy. Company personnel at all levels of the company take part in TQM. 
  In this respect training, culture, teamwork, and common strategic goals are
  all an essential part of the TQM implementation.   
  </p>
  <p>
  Common TQM practices:
  </p>
      <ul>
      <li>"Statistical process control is the use of statistical process control 
      charts to provide operators with feedback, allowing them to base their actions
      on the variability of the manufacturing process. </li>
      <li> Product design for quality includes improving design characteristics 
      through design for manufacturability and reliability engineering. </li>
      <li>Throughout customer focus is designed to better assess customer needs and 
      an organization's effectiveness in meeting them. </li>
      <li> Information feedback provides the workforce with process and performance
      information to assist with decentralized management of the production process
      and variance minimization. </li>
      <li> Management support includes communication of strategy, development of 
      corporate culture, or the social energy that drives the organization" (1).
      </ul>
  
  <h2> Relationship between just in time (JIT) and TQM</h2>
  <p>
"Worldclass manufacturing is a synthesis of just-in-time (JIT),
total quality management (TQM), employee involvement, preventive
maintenance practices, computer-integrated manufacturing, and strategic 
management. Hence, our consultancy offers implementation of JIT in parallel with
TQM. The two approaches have common practices and evidence suggests that JIT 
practices improve quality performance through problem exposure and improved
process feedback.
"JIT practices affect quality performance
by reducing lot sizes, which reduces potential scrap and rework resulting
from process failure. Furthermore, inventory reduction practices
associated with JIT induce immediate parts starvation in the event of a
process problem, forcing fast and concerted problem-solving efforts, with
obvious benefits for quality performance. These and other relationships are
postulated to cause JIT and TQM approaches to function more effectively
when used in unison"(1).
